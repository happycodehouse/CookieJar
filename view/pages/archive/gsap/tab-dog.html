                THE DOG, the brand for <br>
                the society and our daily lives.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2000, THE DOG was created with the unique images and perspectives captured and made possible using a
                fisheye lens.
                <br>
                Since then, THE DOGâ€™s images and related character goods have been distributed in more than 50
                countries,
                <br>
                and is now a recognizable iconic character well-loved by fans all over the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ushering in our 20th anniversary, THE DOG has undergone some revamps in our branding, <br>
                to keep THE DOG relevant and in touch with the latest trends and needs, <br>
                while staying true to our roots and the familiarity of our unique characters.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition, SAVE THE DOG PROJECT was also established and created to assist and support the activities
                of the various animal rescue organizations and animal shelters,
                <br>
                by committing a portion of our revenue to them through donations.
            </p>

            <p>
                With the mindset of providing and contributing back to the society through our business, <br>
                we aim to pursue our mission to create a sustainable contribution system through the growth and
                expansion of our business, <br>
                and strive to be a brand that will play an important role in our society and daily lives.
