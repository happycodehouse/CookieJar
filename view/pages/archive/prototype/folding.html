                                    I went to the electronic store and got a humidifier for my office. <br>
                                    I usually decide pretty quickly when I'm shopping; oh my gosh, there were so many
                                    kinds.
                                    <br>
                                    I must have looked through the entire store like a dozen times, and I couldn't make
                                    a
                                    decision, still. <br>
                                    So you know what I did? I bought the most expensive one.
                                </p>

                                    Kim and her husband, both were in their late thirties when they first met. <br>
                                    They got married pretty quickly. <br>
                                    Not long after that, they had their first child, Oscar. <br>
                                    She decided to take a break from work to raise Oscar herself. <br>
                                    She went back to work as soon as Oscar was old enough to go to kindergarten.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I went to an appliance store and bought a washing machine. <br>
                                    They said that it's really quiet, so I even use it late at night, my neighborhood
                                    couldn't hear it. <br>
                                    I often work late and come home after 10 o'clock. So I really needed it. <br>
                                    It's arriving next week on the 16th.
                                </p>

                                    I needed a new laptop and found a good deal online, so I ordered one. <br>
                                    But apparently, the delivery company that is shipping it has closed down a few of
                                    their
                                    distribution warehouses because of the pandemic. <br>
                                    It has been a week, and it looks like it's going to take a little longer.
                                </p>

                                    When I was little, both of my parents had to work. <br>
                                    So I didn't get to go home right after school. <br>
                                    I had to stay at a daycare center for several hours, but it wasn't bad at all. <br>
                                    I got to meet a lot of new friends.
                                </p>

                                    When she was in college, she had to work when she wasn't working. <br>
                                    She didn't get to do something that people generally want to do when they're in
                                    college.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    She gave a good presentation. We got to learn about raising children. <br>
                                    However, we didn't get to ask questions; there wasn't enough time.
