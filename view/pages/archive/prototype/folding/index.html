                    You just can't stand the way that I walked out from the <b>wreckage</b> <br>
                    Can't understand the way that I turned <b>myself</b> around <br>
                    I try to terminate this war, with you <br>
                    But you won't let it go <b>you</b> keep coming back for more <br>
                    Freedom <br>
                    I'm taking it back <br>
                    I'm outta here, no turning back <br>
                    In a <b>baby blue</b> Cadillac <br>
                    Just when I was stalling, I heard an angel calling <br>
                    This is your life, you can go anywhere <br>
                    You gotta grab the wheel and own it and drive it like you stole it <br>
                    Rollin, this is your life, you can be anything <br>
                    You gotta learn to rock and roll it, you gotta put the pedal down <br>
                    And drive it like you stole it, and drive it like you stole it <br>
                    We get stuck in the dirt and we cant see where we're going <br>
                    We've faced all kinds of hurt and the friction slows us down <br>
                    But I won't be waiting here for the world to end in gold <br>
                    I leave your dust behind me stranded in the road <br>
                    Freedom <br>
                    I'm taking it back <br>
                    Attitude I'm giving it back, in a baby blue Cadillac <br>
                    Just when I was stalling, I heard an angel calling <br>
                    This is your life, you can go anywhere <br>
                    You gotta grab the wheel and own it, you gotta put the pedal down <br>
                    And drive it like you stole it <br>
                    This is your life, you can go anywhere <br>
