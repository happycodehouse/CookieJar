                I went to the electronics store and got a humidifier for my office. <br>
                I usually decide pretty quickly when I'm shopping; oh my gosh, there were so many
                kinds.
                <br>
                I must have looked through the entire store like a dozen times, and I couldn't make
                a
                decision, still. <br>
                So you know what I did? I bought the most expensive one.
            </p>

            <p>
                Kim and her husband, both were in their late thirties when they first met. <br>
                They got married pretty quickly. <br>
                Not long after that, they had their first child, Oscar. <br>
                She decided to take a break from work to raise Oscar herself. <br>
                She went back to work as soon as Oscar was old enough to go to kindergarten.
            </p>

            <p>
                I went to an appliance store and bought a washing machine. <br>
                They said that it's really quiet, so I even use it late at night, my neighborhood
                couldn't hear it. <br>
                I often work late and come home after 10 o'clock. So I really needed it. <br>
                It's arriving next week on the 16th.
            </p>

            <p>
                I needed a new laptop and found a good deal online, so I ordered one. <br>
                But apparently, the delivery company that is shipping it has closed down a few of
                their
                distribution warehouses because of the pandemic. <br>
                It has been a week, and it looks like it's going to take a little longer.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I was little, both of my parents had to work. <br>
                So I didn't get to go home right after school. <br>
                I had to stay at a daycare center for several hours, but it wasn't bad at all. <br>
                I got to meet a lot of new friends.
            </p>

            <p>
                When she was in college, she had to work when she wasn't working. <br>
                She didn't get to do something that people generally want to do when they're in
                college.
            </p>

            <p>
                She gave a good presentation. We got to learn about raising children. <br>
                However, we didn't get to ask questions; there wasn't enough time.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I was studying in China, I got to try a lot of unusual food.
